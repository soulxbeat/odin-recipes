    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Deceptively easy to make, yet so full of flavor.  This dish is chock-full of tasty veggies and tender, juicy chicken breast strips!</p>
    <p>Starting with sesame oil, ginger, and garlic, the base flavor is the foundation for the sweet mirin and savory soy sauce to build upon.  Quick sauteing the veggies keeps them cripsy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The chicken can be cut into strips or cubed chunks, whichever you prefer!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced or crushed (or more if you're a garlic fiend like me!)</li>
