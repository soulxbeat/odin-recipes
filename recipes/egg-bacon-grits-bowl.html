    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>I love breakfast.  It's my favorite thing to cook, honestly.  This is a quick, easy, and super filling dish and it's DELICOUS :9</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 eggs</li>
      <li>2-3 slices of bacon</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Uncooked grits</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Cheese (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the bacon however you prefer.  If cooking in the oven, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Once preheated,  line a baking sheet with tin foil and lay the bacon strips out on it.  Place in oven and cook for 20-25 minutes or until as dark and crispy as you like.  If cooking on the stove, place bacon strips on a cold frying pan and place over medium heat.  Cook for about 7-10 minutes - longer if you like really crispy bacon - flipping once during cooking.  Remove from heat and let drain on a paper towel.</li>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, combine grits, a good couple dashes of salt, and water and bring to a boil while stirring frequently, then cover and reduce heat to a simmer.  Let cook for 5-7 minutes until at desired thickness, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>In the same frying pan used for the bacon (using either the fat from the bacon or butter), heat it back up to medium heat and fry the egg until it's done the way you like it, seasoning it with salt and pepper before you flip it.</li>
      <li>Grab you a bowl, scoop your grits into it, and top with butter, salt, and pepper.  Take your egg(s) and bacon and place on top.  Enjoy your epic breakfast!</li>
    </ol>
