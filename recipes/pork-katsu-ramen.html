    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This is one of my favorite dishes!  The broth is simmered with green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce and mirin.  Just add your favorite noodles and toppings.  I like to use mushrooms, bok choy, daikon radish and red peppers.  If you're feeling adventurous, add some chili paste or fresh chopped chili peppers or jalapenoes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 to 1 1/2 cup Sesame oil</li>
      <li>Thin sliced pork loin chops (for as many bowls as you want to make)</li>
      <li>5 thin slices of daikon radish</li>
      <li>1 stalk bok choy (more if more than one bowl)</li>
      <li>1/4 red pepper, diced or thin sliced strips</li>
      <li>1 green onion, sliced (save the root part for the broth)</li>
      <li>A handful of dried shiitake mushrooms, rinsed and patted dry</li>
      <li>1 fresh jalapeno or chili pepper, sliced</li>
      <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
      <li>1 package of soba or ramen style noodles (for each bowl)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>1 Egg (2 or more if cooking more than one pork loin)</li>
      <li>1 to 1 1/2 cup flour</li>
      <li>1 to 1 1/2 cup panko crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook noodles according to package directions.</li>
      <li>In a large pot, combine chicken stock, soy sauce, mirin, mushrooms, and green onion bottoms.  Bring to a boil for about 5 minutes, then bring down to a simmer while cooking everything else.</li>
      <li>In a skillet or frying pan, heat a full cup of oil over medium heat.</li>
      <li>While heating, set up a plate each with the flour and breadcrumbs.  Then crack an egg and whisk it, pouring it into a bowl and set aside.</li>
      <li>Once the oil is hot, season a pork chop with salt and pepper on both sides and dip it in the flour, then the egg, and finally the breadcrumbs and fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side.  Set aside until ready to slice.</li>
      <li>In a seperate frying pan or skillet, heat a tablespoon of sesame oil on medium high heat and add veggies, stirring frequently - about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove onion roots and mushrooms from the broth and set the mushrooms aside to add to the bowls.  Slice pork, place noodles in bowl and pour broth over them.  Place veggies and pork on top of noodles and broth and enjoy!</li>
